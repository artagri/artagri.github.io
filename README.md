# Ad Maiorem Dei Gloriam

## Wening lan Dunung
Of a thousand years of my life, of a joyful life or terrible act I committed, I finally brave myself coming here. I confess all my past. I mourn the sad past, I regret the terrible past and I rejoice the happy past. Before The Mountain, The Moon and The Lake, I bowed and shook the of hand of The Past. 

At last, I made a peace with my past in that night. A night without fireworks, without any cars or people noise. A mere cricket and a mild sound of water flow. A night of tranquil and peace, wening and dunung.
